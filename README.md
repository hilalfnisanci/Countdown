# Countdown

Countdown is an application designed to help users keep track of their upcoming events. Users can add events with titles and specific dates. The application then notifies users when the event day arrives. Additionally, users have the flexibility to edit or delete events as needed. On the home page, events are listed along with the remaining days until the event, providing users with a clear understanding of how much time is left. For instance, it may display "24 days left" for an event. Furthermore, users can categorize their events based on their preferences by choosing colors in addition to dates and titles.
